### Problem Statement
Build a Car Price prediction using Machine Learning.

UsedCar.com, a well-known business, is an online marketplace that enables customers to sell or buy a vehicle throughout Germany. When they receive a request to sell an automobile, one of their sales representatives goes to the client's location to gather all the information, including Brand Name, Model Name, year, KMS Driven, and Fuel Type. Once you return to the office, the backend staff will analyze the information that the salesperson supplied and forecast the car's current pricing. The salesperson then visits the client once more to discuss the price.

They find the process to be extremely time-consuming, so they resolve to make it intelligent, automated, and clever. They therefore decide to use a system that will forecast the client's pricing. As a result, the client will be pleased with the special response and be able to sell or buy a car through UsedCar.com, increasing the company's share price by 35% after making the procedure quick and creative.

They therefore made the decision to create a website that will display the current pricing of the automobile based on user inputs such as Brand Name, Model Name, year, KMS Driven, and Fuel type. Here, they plan to employ a machine learning algorithm that will automatically forecast the price of the car based on its characteristics.

For that, our domain experts and data analysts met with the client at Quikr's headquarters to better grasp their problem and expectations. So they asked the client directly for the necessary information.

1) name        >> Name of the car (Including Model Number & version)	

2) company	 >> Car Brand

3) year	     >> Year of the model

4) Price 	   >> Present price of the Car 	

5) kms_driven  >> Kilometer driven by the Car	

6) fuel_type   >> Whether Car runs on Petrol/Diesel/LPG

In order to detect patterns in the dataset using the aforementioned features and attributes supplied by the client, the client wishes to train a machine learning pipeline. Once the user provides new information, our ML model will then automatically predict the price of the car.

As we are aware, Price exhibits consistent behavior. It is referred to as "Regression." Therefore, the price prediction for cars falls within the "Regression" linked kind. So, in order to forecast the cost of the car, we are utilizing the "Regression Algorithm.
