# Problem Statement
## Build a Car Price prediction using Machine Learning.

One of well know start-up in germany namely UsedCar.com, is an online marketplace that enables customers to sell or buy a vehicle throughout Germany. When they receive a request to sell an automobile, one of their sales representatives goes to the client's location to gather all the information, including Brand Name, Model Name, year, Engine Fuel Type, and Engine HP, etc. Once you return to the office, the backend staff will analyze the information that the salesperson supplied and forecast the car's current pricing. The salesperson then visits the client once more to discuss the price.

They find the process to be extremely time-consuming, so they resolve to make it intelligent, automated, and clever. They therefore decide to use a system that will forecast the client's pricing. As a result, the client will be pleased with the special response and be able to sell or buy a car through UsedCar.com, increasing the company's share price by 35% after making the procedure quick and creative.

They therefore made the decision to create a website that will display the current pricing of the automobile based on user inputs such as Brand Name, Model Name, year, Engine Fuel Type, and Engine HP, etc. Here, they plan to employ a machine learning algorithm that will automatically forecast the price of the car based on its characteristics.

For that, our domain experts and data analysts met with the client at Quikr's headquarters to better grasp their problem and expectations. So they asked the client directly for the necessary information.

Now we observe the each features present in the dataset.<br>

Make: The Make feature is the brand name of the Car.
Model: The Model feature is the brand of model or different version of Car models.
Year: The year describes the year of launched.
Engine Fuel Type: It defines the Fuel type of the car model.
Engine HP: Engine HP means Horsepower that refers to the power an engine produces.
Engine Cylinders: Engine Cylinders are number of cylinders in present in the engine.
Transmission Type: It is the type of feature that describe about the car transmission type i.e Mannual or automatic.
Driven_Wheels: The type of wheel drive.
No of doors: It defined nos of doors present in the car.
Market Category: This features tells about the type of car or which category the car belongs.
Vehicle Size: It's say about the about car size.
Vehicle Style: The feature is all about the style that belongs to car.
highway MPG: The average a car will get while driving on an open stretch of road without stopping or starting, typically at a higher speed.
city mpg: City MPG refers to driving with occasional stopping and braking.
Popularity: It can refered to rating of that car or popularity of car.
MSRP: The price of that car.

In order to detect patterns in the dataset using the aforementioned features and attributes supplied by the client, the client wishes to train a machine learning pipeline. Once the user provides new information, our ML model will then automatically predict the price of the car.

As we are aware, Price exhibits consistent behavior. It is referred to as "Regression." Therefore, the price prediction for cars falls within the "Regression" linked kind. So, in order to forecast the cost of the car, we are utilizing the "Regression Algorithm."
